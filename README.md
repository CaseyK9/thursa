# thursa
This is a companion script which provides a basic interface and UX for NRSC5.

To use it you'll need to install NRSC5: https://github.com/theori-io/nrsc5

Once you have NRSC5 going, clone and run the thursa script and follow the prompts.

^c to exit it while playing

note: the "Processed" stream uses MPV to process the stream, so if you don't have MPV installed the script will error out there. To fix, install MPV or use the unprocessed option in thursa.
